ERP system project is made with the help of REACT,

I have made a DASHBOARD interface which contains basic information about total no of products and total no of orders. We can 
navigate to different sections such as PRODUCTS and to ORDERS section page just by clicking on the buttons on the dashboard.

Now , moving towards the products section, there is a SIDEBAR that shows different CATEGORIES of products that are present and
we can see different categories of products just by clicking on the categories, by clicking products with clicked category wil
be displayed.
